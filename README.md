📘 Project Overview

This repository contains an exploratory data analysis (EDA) project focused on ESG (Environmental, Social, Governance) performance, financial metrics, and sustainability trends across industries and regions.

The analysis follows a structured workflow, from data understanding and preparation to visualization and insight generation, with the goal of providing actionable recommendations for companies and stakeholders.

📂 Dataset Details

Contents: Company-level financials (Revenue, MarketCap, GrowthRate, Profit), ESG scores (Overall, Environmental, Social, Governance), and sustainability indicators (Carbon, Energy, Water usage, Emissions per Revenue).

Granularity: Data is broken down by company, industry, region, and year.

Purpose: Enables exploration of the relationship between financial growth, resource efficiency, and ESG performance.

(If your dataset is private or simulated, you can note: "Dataset is proprietary/simulated for academic purposes.")

🛠️ Work Details

Performed data cleaning (handling missing values, outliers, standardizing units).

Conducted univariate, bivariate, and multivariate analyses to uncover financial and ESG patterns.

Developed 12 key EDA questions and visualized findings with line plots, bar charts, scatter plots, and heatmaps.

Structured results in a streamlined analysis flow (financial → industry → ESG → regional comparisons).

Extracted insights and translated them into policy-style recommendations for stakeholders.
