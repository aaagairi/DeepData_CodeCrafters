🌍 ESG & Financial Performance Analysis
📘 Project Overview

This repository contains an Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) project exploring the relationship between:

Financial performance (Revenue, MarketCap, GrowthRate, Profit)

Sustainability indicators (Carbon, Energy, Water, Emissions per Revenue)

ESG performance (Overall, Environmental, Social, Governance scores)

The goal is to uncover actionable insights and generate recommendations for companies and stakeholders on improving sustainability while maintaining financial growth.

📂 Dataset Details

Source: Company-level dataset (financial + ESG metrics + sustainability usage).

Granularity: Records by company, industry, region, and year.

Variables included:

Financial: Revenue, Profit, GrowthRate, MarketCap

ESG: ESG_Overall, ESG_Environmental, ESG_Social, ESG_Governance

Sustainability: Carbon, Energy, Water, Emissions per Revenue

Note: Dataset is included in this repository (company_esg_financial_dataset.csv).

🛠️ Work Details

Performed data cleaning (handling missing values, outliers, standardization).

Conducted 12 key EDA questions spanning univariate, bivariate, multivariate, and time-series analysis.

Developed stream-structured plots (line charts, bar charts, scatter plots, heatmaps) for intuitive exploration.

Extracted 5–7 insights with real-world sustainability implications.

Proposed 3–5 policy recommendations to help organizations and regions improve ESG performance.

Packaged results into both plots and a presentation deck (CodeCrafters_Round1.pptx).
